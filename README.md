# Speech-to-Text with OpenAI's Whisper Model

## Overview

This Python implementation utilizes OpenAI's Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model to convert spoken language into written text. The Whisper model is a powerful tool for accurate and efficient Speech-to-Text applications.

## Installation

To get started, install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers torchaudio
```

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries and load the Whisper model:

    ```python
    from transformers import pipeline
    speech_to_text = pipeline("whisper-large", model="facebook/whisper-large")
    ```

2. Provide the path to the audio file you want to transcribe:

    ```python
    audio_file_path = "path/to/audio/file.wav"
    ```

3. Perform Speech-to-Text conversion:

    ```python
    result = speech_to_text(audio_file_path)
    ```

4. Access the transcribed text:

    ```python
    transcribed_text = result[0]['sentence']
    print(f"Transcribed Text: {transcribed_text}")
    ```

## Notes

- Ensure that the audio file is in WAV format for optimal results.
- Adjust the `audio_file_path` variable to point to your specific audio file.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on the [Whisper ASR model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/whisper-large) by OpenAI. Visit the official [OpenAI GitHub repository](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for more details.
